        The International Conference on Microelectronics has been held in numerous countries across
        the Middle East and Asia for the past 26 years. The 27th edition of the conference will be held
        in Casablanca, Morocco. IEEE-ICM 2015 will include oral, poster sessions and tutorials given by
        experts on state-of-the-art topics. The regular technical program will run for three days. In addition,
        tutorial sessions will be held on the first day of the conference. Papers are solicited in, but not
        limited to, the following topics:

        Casablanca the largest city of Morocco, is located in the western part of the country on the
        Atlantic Ocean. It is also the largest city in the Maghreb, as well as one of the largest
        and most important cities in Africa, both economically and demographically. Casablanca is
        Morocco’s chief port and industrial center. The 2012 census, adjusted with recent numbers,
        recorded a population of about 4 million in the prefecture of Casablanca and about 5 million
        in the region of Grand Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center
        of Morocco, while the national political capital is Rabat. The leading Moroccan companies and
        international corporations doing business there have their headquarters and main industrial
        facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca retains its historical
        position as the main industrial zone of the country. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest
        artificial ports in the world, and the largest port of North Africa.It is also the primary naval
        base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.

        Jean-Michel Sallese is currently appointed Maître d’Enseignement et de Recherche at
        the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. After obtaining the PhD in
        physics from the university of Nice-Sophia Antipolis in 1991 (CNRS), he joined the EPFL
        where he started working on semiconductor lasers and diffusion in highly confined systems.
        Next, his research activities focused on the so-called EKV model, giving it its recent physics
        based foundations which core relationships are now implemented in the BSIM6 model. Next,
        he developed different charge based models for emerging field effect electron devices, and
        in particular for the so-called multigate gate FETs and junction-less FETs, while still maintaining
        strong links with physics. Besides, he proposed a novel concept of enhanced diodes and resistances to
        model minority carriers generation and propagation in silicon substrates for smart power applications,
        including EDS prediction. More recently, bio-sensors fabricated in CMOS technology became part of his
        activities with a new concept of bio-sensor in SOI technology which is under development. Jean-Michel
        Sallese is currently giving lectures on modelling emerging semiconductor devices as well as in silicon
        technology dedicated to integrated circuits.
        He was also lecturing in the framework of the IDESA courses (EC project) from 2008 to 2012.

After two years working as a microelectronics industrial process engineer for SGS-Thomson in Casablanca, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship in 1997 to join the Master’s of Science program of the University of Florida, Gainesville from which he graduated in 1998. He obtained a Ph.D. from Texas A&M University, College Station in 2002. After graduating, he was among the pioneers who started STMicroelectronics’ Rabat Integrated Circuit Design center, a first in Africa. He held several management positions within STM and ST-Ericsson while concurrently holding an adjunct faculty position at Al Akhawayn University. He served as ST-Ericsson representative at USB-IF Board of Directors and as their representative in MIPI – Technical Steering Group and MIPI-Unipro workgroup vice-chair. He has co-authored a number of scientific publications and industry standards in wireless communications over the span of his 19 years of experience and was elected as an IEEE senior member. After several years of successful leadership in driving innovative ecosystems involving industries and universities in Morocco, he co-founded and currently serves as the president of the Morocco Microelectronics Cluster, a government backed non-for-profit Industry-Academic consortium. In 2013, he joined Mascir management team, a Moroccan non for profit foundation conducting market oriented R&D in Microelectronics, Biotechnology & Nano-materials. He currently serves as its Chief Executive Officer]]></string>
